# Flutter get API call with Null Safety:
### 1. Go to the website -> ## jsonplaceholder ### ->Go Routes ->Get /Posts->copy the URL ->Check this URL in PostMan.
### 2. Go to the Flutter project -> go pubspec.yaml and pubget http: ^0.13.4 -> and import http package (import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;)
### 3. When we install plugins in flutter project ,it's not working untill there's exist a name of api's object or array.So theres's a problem to create a exact moel we want.For this go to the lib of flutter project and create a directory named-> Models.
### 4. Again go to the Models -> New ->Json To Dart -> create class name (PostsModel) -> if our project show null safety then click this ->now copy paste the api code from the PostsMan and generate it.
